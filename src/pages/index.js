            Hello friend! My name is Christina and I am a scientist turned Developer. I have been working as a Software Engineer and teaching myself coding and debugging skills.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Coding, I run into many challanges on a daily basis so I created this blog to give back to the community. Seriously, if you are just starting out, you are not alone. We are all here to help each other.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Over time, through lots of trial and error, and learning from others, I have discovered strategies to implement and debug. I want to share them with you.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Check out my Blog posts below and I would love to hear from you. Let me know what you think, ask me a question or let me know if there is a better way of solving something. Learning together is the best part of the job. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Happy Hacking!
