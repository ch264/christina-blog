# Code with Christina Blog

Welcome to my Blog. This is my first blog that I build and here is the Tech stack that I chose:

    * Gatsby
    * JavaScript
    * React
    * Netlify
    * Markdown

## What is your blog about? 

I am a cell and molecular scientist turned software engineer. Every day I debug and discover new ways of coding and solving challanges. I would like to share the tough parts I figure out with you. 

Let me know what you think. 

Please also feel free to contribute to my blog. A contribution doc is in progress.

Happy Hacking!
