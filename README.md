# Code with Christina Blog

Welcome to my Blog. This is my first blog that I build and here is the Tech stack that I chose:

    * Gatsby
    * JavaScript
    * React
    * Netlify
    * Markdown
## What Gatsby starter did you use? 

I used different elements from two Gatsby starters: 
   * https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/jooplaan/gatsby-london-night-and-day/
   * https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/vaporwavy/gatsby-london-after-midnight/

## What is your blog about? 

I am a cell and molecular scientist turned software engineer. Every day I debug and discover new ways of coding and solving challanges. I would like to share the tough parts I figure out with you. 

Let me know what you think. 

Please also feel free to contribute to my blog. A contribution doc is in progress.

Happy Hacking!
